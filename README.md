# Optimizing-Solar-Farm-Perfomance-and-Estimating-ROI
An analysis examining how solar farm performance impacts estimated ROI for renewable energy projects.

# Step 1: Define Objectives & Scope

## Objective
Analyze solar energy performance and estimate financial outcomes for hypothetical projects to showcase operational and business insights.

## Scope
- Analyze 1â€“3 solar farms or projects.
- Timeframe: 1 year of energy output data.
- Include basic financial analysis: revenue estimation, ROI, payback period.

## Key Questions
1. How does solar energy output vary with weather conditions?
2. What revenue can be expected under realistic tariff rates?
3. What is the estimated ROI and payback period for the projects?
